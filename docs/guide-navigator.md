# Using the navigator

The "Navigator" plugin enables browsing and manipulation of resources (e.g. packages and tables, a.k.a. entity types).
Resources can be created/edited, moved/copied, uploaded/downloaded and deleted.

## Browse folders and tables

Navigate trough folders, click to enter folders. Use the bread crumb above the buttons to go back.
Use the checkbox to select items for manipulations (see below).

## Search and Find
Use the search box to find resources. Search results are displayed in the table. It is possible to
select search results and move/copy or download the selection.

Entity type editing is enabled for users with access to the metadata manager plugin.

## Cut resources
Cutting selected resources places them on the clipboard. Subsequently selecting the copy/paste icon
will copy/move the clipboard resources to the current package.

## Move resources
Resources on the clipboard can be moved to another package by navigating to another package and
selecting the paste icon.

### Copy resources
Copied resources on the clipboard can be pasted anywhere with the paste button. When copying one or
more packages, the contents of those packages will be copied as well.

If you are copying multiple entity types at the same time, references between those entity types
will also be copied. References to resources that are not being copied at the moment will keep
pointing to that resource. The following diagram depicts how references are copied:

## Upload file
Upload allow for adding resources to the current package. Uploading is enabled for users with access to the import plugin.

## Download folders and tables
Packages and entities can be downloaded in EMX format by selecting them and clicking the download button.
A progress message will be shown on screen, this message will contain the link to download the EMX file once the download is ready.

Downloading is enabled for users with permissions to create download jobs and files in the system.
By default this is true for users with the role "Manager" or "Editor" and superusers.

###Limitations
Only entities that follow the naming scheme "PACKAGE_ENITYNAME" as identifier can be downloaded.
Also the identifier cannot be longer that 31 characters due to sheet name length limitations in some older spreadsheet programs.

Tags on your metadata will not be downloaded, these need to be added to either the MOLGENIS database or the file before it can be imported via the import plugin.
