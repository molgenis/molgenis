# Setup security in MOLGENIS
To understand the security context of MOLGENIS you need to understand the following concepts.

* **Group**
  
  A number of people that work together.

* **User**
  
  A person that can login to MOLGENIS.

* **Roles**
  
  A role is a job function within the context of a group with certain permissions on resources. Examples of roles are:
  * Managers
  * Editors
  * Viewers
 
* **Resource**
  
  Resources can be tables or folders.

* **Plugin**
  
  Plugins are specific modules within MOLGENIS that offer certain functionality. For example the [Data Explorer](../finding-data/guide-explore.md).
      
## Add groups
*note: you need to be superuser to add groups*

You can add groups in MOLGENIS by navigating to **Admin --> Security Manager**.

Fill out the necessary field and click on **Create**.

![Create a group](../../images/security/group_creation.png?raw=true, "Create a group")

When you've added the group a folder is created and the default roles are created for that group. The user who creates the group becomes manager of the group.
