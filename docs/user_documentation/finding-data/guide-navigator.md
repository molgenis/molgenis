# Navigator

The "Navigator" plugin enables finding resources (e.g. packages and entity types) as well as manage them.
Resources can be created/edited, moved/copied, uploaded/downloaded and deleted.

Entity type editing is enabled for users with access to the metadata manager plugin.

## Move and Copy
The Cut, Copy and Paste icons control the clipboard and can be used to move and copy resources.
Cutting selected resources places them on the clipboard. Subsequently selecting the copy/paste icon
will copy/move the clipboard resources to the current package.

### Move
Resources on the clipboard can be moved to another package by navigating to another package and 
selecting the paste icon.

### Copy
Copied resources on the clipboard can be pasted anywhere with the paste button. When copying one or
more packages, the contents of those packages will be copied as well.

If you are copying multiple entity types at the same time, references between those entity types 
will also be copied. References to resources that are not being copied at the moment will keep 
pointing to that resource. The following diagram depicts how references are copied:
