# Creating apps for MOLGENIS
To be able to host your app inside MOLGENIS, you need to create an archive in a specific format.

To get started right away, you can download an [example archive here](../data/example-app.zip).

Following paragraphs will explain in detail how to construct and configure your resources to make it a certified MOLGENIS app.

## Archive structure
If you downloaded the example archive, you probably noticed that the structure of the archive is pretty straight forward.

```
|-- config.json
|-- index.html
|-- app-template.html
|-- js
    |-- example.js
|-- css
    |-- example.css
```

The index.html is your main entry point, and the contents will be interpreted and rendered by a FreeMarker engine. 
Relative to your index.html you can include js and css. 

> note: If you use absolute paths, MOLGENIS is unable to serve your resources properly

### Example

The following example assumes we have a setup according to the tree structure shown in the previous paragraph.

_index.html_
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="css/example.css"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>This is an example of including resources with relative paths</h1>
    </div>
    <script src="js/example.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

_example.js_
```js
alert('this is a wonderful example')
```

_example.css_
```css
.container {
    background: blue;
    height: 400px;
    width: 100%
}
```

> **For production usage**

_app-template.html_

This file is needed by the target MOLGENIS-instance. It will be used to render the index.html for the production app.

```javascript
<div id="app"></div>
```

## Configuration
The config.json is a small configuration file that will tell MOLGENIS about your app. 
It contains the following parameters

| Parameter | type | mandatory | Description |
| ----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| label     |string| yes| The label used to name your app in the app manager screen |
| description |string| yes | A description for your app. Useful for making your app more findable in the app manager |
| version | string |yes |The version of your app. Used to manage app version, updating etc etc.. |
| apiDependency | string |yes | The version of the MOLGENIS REST api you used in your app. Can be used to give warnings about possible incompatibility with a specific version of MOLGENIS |
| name | string |yes | The name of the app. May not contain '/'
| includeMenuAndFooter | boolean |yes | 
  If you want MOLGENIS to serve your app with the standard header (with menu and polyfill), and footer, set this value to __true__ |
| runtimeOptions | object |no | A map containing initial parameters you might want to give to your app on init |

### Example
The following example shows every possible configuration option currently available

_config.json_
```json
{
	"label": "Example app",
	"description": "This is an example app",
	"version": "v1.0.0",
	"apiDependency": "v2",
	"name": "example",
	"includeMenuAndFooter": true,
	"runtimeOptions": {
		"language": "en"
	}
}
```

_Note that you can not create a config.json on your root path of the project. It will not build anymore._



## Available javascript variables
MOLGENIS deploys apps with a bit of system information inside a global variable to get your app up and running. These are described below.

```js
window.__INITIAL_STATE__ = {
  baseUrl: '', // This is the root URL
  lng: '', // the language set by the system, allows you to implement i18n
  fallbackLng: '' // the fallback language set by the system, defaults to english (en)
}
```

## App resource caching
To enable caching of your resources, ensure your resource files have a hash code included in their file names.
So instead of _example.js_, use _example.0943Ajd09834fd.js_.

Build tools like webpack already generate your source files with a hash code included in the file name.

## Using webpack for rapid app prototyping
To use webpack in rapid prototyping of your MOLGENIS apps, use the standard webpack template 
and make some small tweaks to make it a `build -> compress -> upload` workflow.

First you need to install 2 plugins:

```javascript
yarn --dev add zip-webpack-plugin@2.0.0
yarn --dev add generate-json-webpack-plugin
```

Make sure that you set the following two parameters in your production config. 

In **config/index.js**

```js
const packageJson = require('../package')

module.exports = {
  // ...
  build: {
    // ...
    assetsSubDirectory: '',
    assetsPublicPath: '/plugin/app/' + packageJson.name,
    // ...
  }
}
```

In **build/webpack.prod.conf.js**

```javascript
plugins: [
  
  ...  
  
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    filename: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'testing'
      ? 'index.html'
      : config.build.index,
    template: 'app-template.html',
    inject: true,
    minify: {
      removeComments: true,
      collapseWhitespace: true,
      removeAttributeQuotes: true
      // more options:
      // https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier#options-quick-reference
    },
    // necessary to consistently work with multiple chunks via CommonsChunkPlugin
    chunksSortMode: 'dependency'
  }),
      
  ...   
  
  new GenerateJsonPlugin('config.json', {
      name: packageJson.name,
      label: packageJson.name,
      description: packageJson.description,
      version: packageJson.version,
      apiDependency: "v2",
      includeMenuAndFooter: true,
      runtimeOptions: {
        language: "en"
      }
    }),

    // copy custom static assets
    new CopyWebpackPlugin([
      {
        from: path.resolve(__dirname, '../static'),
        to: config.build.assetsSubDirectory,
        ignore: ['.*']
      }
    ]),

    new ZipPlugin({
      filename: packageJson.name + '.zip'
    })
  ]
```

These settings will ensure that your compiled resources are already in the correct file structure, and references to your resources are relative.

**app-template.html**

This file is needed by the target MOLGENIS-instance. It will be used to render the index.html for the production app.
```javascript
<div id="app"></div>
```
