For each ALT allele in the same order as listed = 0/0,0/1,1/1,0/2,1/2,2/2,0/3,1/3,2/3,3/3,etc. Phasing is ignored; hence 1/0, 0|1 and 1|0 are all counted as 0/1. When one or more alleles is not called for a genotype in a specific sample (./., ./0, ./1, ./2, etc.), that sample's genotype is completely discarded for calculating GTC.">
