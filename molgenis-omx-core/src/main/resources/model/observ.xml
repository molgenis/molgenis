		<description>
			Observ-OM is a model to uniformly describe any phenotypic, genotypic
			or
			molecular observation. The four core concepts are:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>ObservationTarget:</b>
					the object we are observing.
					<br />
					For example: an Individual,
					a Panel/Strain, a Sample, a Gene, a
					Marker.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>ObservableFeature:</b>
					the question asked or characteristic being
					oberveded.
					<br />
					For example: 'What is height of [Target]?', 'What is genotype of
					[Target] at
					[Marker]?', 'Has [Target] ever used medicine [X]', 'What
					is QTL p-value
					association of [Marker] with [Gene Expression]?
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Protocol:</b>
					the procedure of observation
					<br />
					For example: Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), R/QTL mapping
					method,
					Genotype array, GWAS protocol.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Observation:</b>
					the actual act of observation. For example:
					'FFQ asked to
					[Individual:individual1], 'R/QTL applied to
					[Marker:pvv4]',
					'Genotype array applied to [Panel:Mouse RIL BxD 1].
					Each observation
					can have multiple ObservedValue AND be grouped into a DataSet.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<entity name="Characteristic" implements="Identifiable"
			xref_label="Identifier">
			<description> Characteristics are yes-no
				statements about things in
				the world. These can be used as part of an observation, as
				parameter
				of ObservableFeature ('measuredCharacteristic'). For
				example: 'What
				is allele of [Marker]', here the [Marker] is a
				characteristic. Also,
				Characteristics can be used as target of
				observation. Typical
				examples are 'Individual' or 'Panel'. But also
				'Marker' can be an
				Target when asked the question 'QTL p-value for
				[phenotype]': here
				both target and feature are characteristic, for
				example 'leave count'
				(phenotype characteristic) and 'PVV4' (marker
				characteristic).

			<description> ObservationTarget defines subjects of

			<description>
				ObservableFeature defines anything that can be observed.

				In other words, ObservableFeature are the
				questions asked, e.g. 'What
				is Height?', 'What is Systolic blood
				pressure?', or 'Has blue eyes?'.
				<p />
				Some questions may
				be repeated for multiple characteristics. For
				example 'What is [MarkerAllele]
				observed?' can be applied to all
				elements of a MarkerSet, and 'What
				is [medicin codes] uses' can be
				applied to a set of Medicine codes. This can be specified using the
				measuredCharacteristic field.
				<p />
				The identifier of ObservableFeature is globally
				unique. It is

				ObservableFeature is named

				well-defined ontology
