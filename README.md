# Welcome to MOLGENIS

MOLGENIS is a collaborative open source project on a mission to generate great software infrastructure for life science research. 

See http://molgenis.github.io for documentation.

## Installation

## Third-party software
For some modules in MOLGENIS, third-party software is in use. It is important to know that some of these licenses are different than the MOLGENIS license.

In this section you can find a list of remarks about third-party software in MOLGENIS modules.

### molgenis-charts module
As a non-profit organisation we are using the Highsoft software 'highstock version 1.3.6', in the molgenis-charts module to build some charts.

Important! The Highsoft software product is not free for commercial use. For Highsoft products and pricing go to: http://shop.highsoft.com/

To turn-off/deactivate this functionality you can change the relevant setting for the data explorer:  
 1. In the menu select Admin -> Settings
