				version: The version (optional) attribute is used to indicate the version of a coordinate system as a whole. It is used to differentiate between coordinate systems that change infrequently but are fundamentally incompatible between releases. Typically these are genomic.
				test_range:  The test_range (required) attribute is an example segment that may be used to test the source's capabilities. It should be a segment for which the source has data.
